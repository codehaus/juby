=====================================
Juby - an unholy mix of Java and Ruby
=====================================

1) General Build Notes:

  Building Juby requires Ruby Gems, which can be obtained from:

    http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126

1.1) Build Notes for OSX:

  On my system, I have to set:

  export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5.0/Libraries

1.2) Build Notes for Linux:

  JAVA_HOME must be set before building
  
  For example:
  
  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk5
