=====================================
Juby - an unholy mix of Java and Ruby
=====================================

1) General Build Notes:

  1.1) Requirements

  Building Juby requires Ruby Gems, which can be obtained from:

    http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126

  1.2) Developer building

  From the top of the project 'make clean test' will build the gem, install
  it under ./tmp, run the tests, and generally make sure it all works.

  It *will* not install it globally in your ruby gem's repository.

2) Build Notes for OSX:

  On my system, I have to set:

  export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5.0/Libraries

3) Build Notes for Linux:

  JAVA_HOME must be set before building
  
  For example:
  
  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk5

4) Installation

  'make install' as root will build the gem and then install it
  into the correct location for your environment.


5) Uninstallation

  'make uninstall' as root will use gem to remove Juby from
  your environment.
